Unix Timestamp Converter
========================

About
-----

Unix Timestamp Converter is a plugin for Geany used to convert unix
epoch timestamps to human readable strings and to also their GPS
timestamp equivalents. The supported timestamp formats include integers
in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds like "1433141615",
"1433141615123", "1433141615123456" as well as floating point like
"1433141615.123" (milliseconds) or "1433141615.123456"
(microseconds). Microseconds or lesser values will not be shown in the
final conversion result!
