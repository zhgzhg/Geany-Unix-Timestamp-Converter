Unix Timestamp Converter
========================

About
-----

Unix Timestamp Converter is a plugin for Geany used to convert unix
epoch timestamps to a human readable string. The supported format of the
timestamp is an integer one for e.g. "1433141615". Timestamps akin to
this type "1433141615.123" will be internally trimmed to "1433141615".

In order to use the plugin you need to mark or copy in clipboard the
text you want to convert and then click on Tools/Unix Timestamp
Converter. The results will appear in 'Messages' tab and/or a new popup
window.
